A deck is created at the beginning of the game.
Both players will be dealt two random cards from the deck at the beginning of the game.

Both players will have/are able to:
  - click the 'hit' button to be dealt a new card,           after which the score will be updated.
  - click the 'stick' button to stay with their current score - after both players have done this the winner will be determined and the buttons are disabled
  - The win result displayed underneath the correct player

If either player goes bust (score over 21) then the result is displayed and all buttons disabled.
